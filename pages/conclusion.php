            <p>In conclusion, the project was successfully completed using a range of tools. The process began with careful planning, where each team member's strengths were considered, and tasks were assigned accordingly. The documentation team consisted of Jester Lope, Keane Banua, and Mico Flores. The UI team included Laurenz De La Cerna and Julia Bacli, while the development was carried out by Jean Emmanuel C. Trinidad.</p>
            <p>During development, PHP was used as the primary programming language, with HTML providing the structure and CSS managing the design. JavaScript was utilized to add functionality and handle events, while GitHub facilitated code management and collaboration. Tools like Ace served as the code editor, and Swiper was employed to implement a swipe library for a presentation-like effect. Bootstrap streamlined the HTML design, enhancing the efficiency of the development process.
            </p>
            <p>The team utilized several software tools throughout the project. VS Code was chosen for coding, XAMPP was used for server management, and Google Chrome was the browser of choice for testing the application. Ultimately, the team developed a responsive and interactive web application, with all tools working together seamlessly to create a well-organized and efficient final product.
            </p>
            <p>The journey of creating this project was challenging, yet the team demonstrated remarkable resilience and collaboration. Regular meetings were held to discuss progress, troubleshoot issues, and share feedback, ensuring everyone was aligned. Each member brought unique perspectives, enriching the development process and fostering an environment of creativity and innovation.</p>
